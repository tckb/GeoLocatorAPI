GeoLocator-REST-API
===================

The Java-REST API for GeoLocator webservice  compatible to both Java and Android platforms. 

--

Before using the API, it is *strongly* adviced to use the stub generator to generate the stubs located in  <code>com/tckb/geo/stubs</code> to keep consistent to the changes in the rest webservice. The usage is pretty straight forward, the main API is located at <code>com/tckb/geo/api/LocatorREST</code>
